# Clokta: AWS CLI via Okta authentication

Clokta enables you authenticate into an AWS account using Okta on the command line, so that you can run AWS CLI commands.


## To Install

```bash
> pip3 install clokta
```

You will need Python 2.7 or 3 installed on your machine

## To Use

```
> clokta --profile <your-team>
> aws --profile <your-team> s3 ls (or any other aws command you want)
```

This injects temporary keys into your .aws/credentials file that can be accessed with the --profile option.

In addition, it creates a file which can be sourced to enable just the current session:

```
> clokta --profile <your-team>
> source ~/.clokta/<your team>.sh
> aws s3 ls
```

Run AWS commands for the next hour.  After an hour the keys expire and you must rerun clokta.

Applications that access AWS can be run locally if they used the second option that puts the keys in the environment of the current session.

**NOTE:** You will need a ~/.clokta/clokta.cfg file to specify your Okta setup.  Talk to you team about getting one or see below for generating a ~/.clokta/clokta.cfg

## More Info

Clokta will prompt you for a password and, if required, will prompt you for multi-factor authentication.  A typical scenario looks like

```shell
> clokta --profile meridian
Enter a value for okta_password:
1 - Google Authenticator
2 - Okta Verify
3 - SMS text message
4 - Okta Verify with Push
Choose a MFA type to use: 3
Enter your multifactor authentication token: 914345
AWS keys saved to ~/.clokta/meridian.sh. To use, `source ~/.clokta/meridian.sh`
AWS keys saved to ~/.clokta/meridian.env for use with docker compose
>
```

If you always intend on using the same the same MFA mechanism, you can put this in your clokta configuration file (see below)

### AWS Command Line, Local Programs, or Docker Containers

Clokta automatically inserts your credentials into ~/.aws/credentials using the '-p' name.  So you can immediately run aws commands with the '--profile' option.

```
> clokta -p meridian
> aws --profile meridian s3 ls
```

If you are developing applications that access AWS and need to run them locally, you can insert these credentials in your environment.  Clokta generates a shell script ~/.clokta/<profile>.sh for this.

```
> clokta -p meridian
> source ~/.clokta/meridian.sh
> ./bin/meridian
```

If you are building docker containers you can build them with the credentials in the environment using docker-compose's env_file command and referencing the <profile>.env file that clokta automatically creates.  A sample docker-compose.yml would like

```Yml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    env_file:
      - ~/.clokta/meridian.env
    build: .
    ports:
     - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
     - .:/code
```

## Generating a ~/.clokta/clokta.cfg

The ~/.clokta/clokta.cfg will look like this. 

```ini
[DEFAULT]
okta_username = doej
okta_org = washpost.okta.com
multifactor_preference = Okta Verify with Push

[meridian]
okta_aws_app_url = https://washpost.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/0of1f11ff1fff1ffF1f1/272
okta_aws_role_to_assume = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/Okta_Role
okta_idp_provider = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:saml-provider/Okta_Idp
```

### DEFAULT section

Specify your username, org and, if you want, specify which MFA option to use (valid options are 'Google Authenticator', 'Okta Verify with Push', 'SMS text message', and 'Okta Verify').  If you don't specify an MFA option it will prompt you.

### Profile sections

You will have a profile section for each team you work on (try to get the required information from your teammates instead of having to figure it out yourself).  If you plan to login in using multiple roles, you will need a profile for each role.  A more realistic ~/.clokta/clokta.cfg may look like

```ini
[DEFAULT]
okta_username = doej
okta_org = washpost.okta.com
multifactor_preference = Okta Verify with Push

[meridian]
okta_aws_app_url = https://washpost.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/0of1f11ff1fff1ffF1f1/272
okta_aws_role_to_assume = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/Okta_Developer_Access
okta_idp_provider = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:saml-provider/Okta_Idp

[meridian-admin]
okta_aws_app_url = https://washpost.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/0of1f11ff1fff1ffF1f1/272
okta_aws_role_to_assume = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/Okta_Admin_Access
okta_idp_provider = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:saml-provider/Okta_Idp

[pagebuilder]
okta_aws_app_url = https://washpost.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/0oe2e22ee2eee2eeE2e2/272
okta_aws_role_to_assume = arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/Okta_Developer_Access
okta_idp_provider = arn:aws:iam::222222222222:saml-provider/Okta_Idp
```

To get the three parameters, okta_aws_app_url, okta_aws_role_to_assume and okta_idp_provider follow the below steps

- okta_aws_app_url
  - Go to your Okta dashboard, right click on your AWS tile (e.g. ARC-App-Myapp), and copy the link.  It will be something like:
    `https://washpost.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/0oa1f77g6u1hoarrV0h8/272?fromHome=true`
  - Strip off the "?fromHome=true" and that is your okta_aws_app_url
- okta_aws_role_to_assume
  - Go to your AWS Account with the web console.
  - Click on IAM->Roles
  - Find and click the "Okta_Developer_Access" role
  - Copy the "Role Arn".  That is your okta_aws_role_to_assume
- okta_idp_provider
  - Go to your AWS Account with the web console.
  - Click on IAM->Identity providers
  - Find and click the "Washpost_Okta" provider
  - Copy the "Provider Arn".  That is your okta_idp_provider
